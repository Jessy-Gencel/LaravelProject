- **Adding questions to FAQ**: As mentioned already, users can ask questions via the Faq page which will then be sent to an admin for approval and answering. This function is managed by the FAQ controller and can be accessed on the FAQ page.
- **Blacklisting users**: Admins have the option to blacklist users. Once that the blacklist button is pressed the user is unable to access the website. This functionality can be found on the admin dashboard and is managed by the admin controller. To ensure that this functionality is enforced A custom middleware was made to check this field on all users before any routing. It can be found in the bootstap folder in app.php.
